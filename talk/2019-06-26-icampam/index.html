  <meta name="description" content="Precise estimation of gait characteristics has significant potential in health research and can help guide clinical decision making. Reproducible estimation of walking strides can provide useful, precise, and time-varying estimators of the number of steps, cadence, stride and step asymmetry. We propose a novel stride segmentation approach and quantify its effectiveness in the estimation of gait and gait asymmetry. The method consists of a first phase, where a flexible pattern matching approach, called ADaptive Empirical Pattern Transformation (ADEPT), is used to conduct stride segmentation. A parametric nonlinear transformation of time is then used to characterize the level of asymmetry in strides relative to a reference template. The advantage of the approach is that its second phase allows quantification of walking asymmetry in one parameter that is directly related to the speeding and slowing down of one of the treadmill belts, thus providing a mechanistic interpretation of the process. Methods are applied to data collected in an experiment where a healthy adult walked on a split-belt treadmill under different conditions, including gait speed of 1.0, 1.25, 1.56 and 2.0 m/s as well as right foot ahead of left and left foot ahead of right (total N=671 walking strides.) Accelerometry data were collected at 100 Hz simultaneously by three wearable sensors located on the left wrist, left hip and left ankle. The Optotrak motion capture system provided the gold-standard reference for gait characteristics. Results indicate that: (1) the time-warped version of ADEPT estimates of stride cadence agree closely with the gold-standard (mean absolute percentage error was 1.67%, 1.7%, and 4.34% for left ankle, left hip, and left wrist, respectively); (2) the time-warping parameter is highly correlated with the known, imposed stride-asymmetry. Results suggest that the one-parameter characterization of time-warping is a useful and accurate representation of stride asymmetry.">

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="pub-abstract">Precise estimation of gait characteristics has significant potential in health research and can help guide clinical decision making. Reproducible estimation of walking strides can provide useful, precise, and time-varying estimators of the number of steps, cadence, stride and step asymmetry. We propose a novel stride segmentation approach and quantify its effectiveness in the estimation of gait and gait asymmetry. The method consists of a first phase, where a flexible pattern matching approach, called ADaptive Empirical Pattern Transformation (ADEPT), is used to conduct stride segmentation. A parametric nonlinear transformation of time is then used to characterize the level of asymmetry in strides relative to a reference template. The advantage of the approach is that its second phase allows quantification of walking asymmetry in one parameter that is directly related to the speeding and slowing down of one of the treadmill belts, thus providing a mechanistic interpretation of the process. Methods are applied to data collected in an experiment where a healthy adult walked on a split-belt treadmill under different conditions, including gait speed of 1.0, 1.25, 1.56 and 2.0 m/s as well as right foot ahead of left and left foot ahead of right (total N=671 walking strides.) Accelerometry data were collected at 100 Hz simultaneously by three wearable sensors located on the left wrist, left hip and left ankle. The Optotrak motion capture system provided the gold-standard reference for gait characteristics. Results indicate that: (1) the time-warped version of ADEPT estimates of stride cadence agree closely with the gold-standard (mean absolute percentage error was 1.67%, 1.7%, and 4.34% for left ankle, left hip, and left wrist, respectively); (2) the time-warping parameter is highly correlated with the known, imposed stride-asymmetry. Results suggest that the one-parameter characterization of time-warping is a useful and accurate representation of stride asymmetry.</p>
