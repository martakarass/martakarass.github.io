      <description>Package runstats provides methods for fast computation of running sample statistics for time series. The methods utilize Convolution Theorem to compute convolutions via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Implemented running statistics include:
 mean, standard deviation, variance, covariance, correlation, euclidean distance.
