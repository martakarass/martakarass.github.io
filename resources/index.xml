      <description>I and Guoqing Wang we are hosting the Department of Biostatistics students Computing Club for 2018-19 academic year.
 Computing Club is one-hour session which gives students opportunities to share and develop computing skills useful for biostatisticians. It is held every other Tuesday 12:15-1:15 PM at JH SPH. Importantly, food üçïüçå is provided in every session!
